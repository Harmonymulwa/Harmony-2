# Introduction

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence \(AI\) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. In machine learning, computers apply statistical learning techniques to automatically identify patterns in data.

It is a sub-field of computer science and artificial intelligence which deals with building systems that can learn from data, instead of explicitly programmed instructions.

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as 

> a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition:

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E‚Äù

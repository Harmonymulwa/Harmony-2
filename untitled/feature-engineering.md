# Feature Engineering

### Feature Selection 

you select a subset of the original feature set. Feature Selection methods choose features from the original set based on some criteria, Information Gain, Correlation and Mutual Information are just criteria that are used to filter out unimportant or redundant features.

### **Feature extraction**

you build a new set of features from the original feature set. Feature Extraction methods are transformative -- that is you are applying a transformation to your data to project it into a new feature space with lower dimension. PCA is example of this.
